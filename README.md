# Clustering Project BNUT
This project is aimed to develop a clustering algorithm to divide students in the Babol Noshirvani University of Technology's dormitory.
For this purpose, I considered the personality and culture, and personal habits of individuals.
First based on personality and culture I divided students into floors, then based on personal habits I put them in rooms. in each room, there are four students. By habits, I mean the taste of students in having activities at night or at the day and the habit of smoking.
